                    <h1>Our staff is prepared to advise donors who wish to contribute their support. There are many ways to give and we welcome the opportunity to suggest how charitable contributions can have both an immediate impact and lasting benefit for both the hospital and the donor.</h1>

                        <div class="target">
                            <p>This is the most popular form of giving to support the programs and services at Milford Hospital. All contributions are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law and may be unrestricted and used to support the entire mission of the hospital or may be restricted for a specific project, program or hospital service.</p>
                            <p>There are many types of outright gifts including:</p>
                            <h3>Securities</h3>
                            <p>Donors may also choose to make gifts of stocks, bonds or the revenue generated from the sale of real estate. There can be a substantial tax advantage for utilizing your appreciated securities to support Milford Hospital. You will pay no taxes on the gain in shares that you donate, plus you will be able to deduct the fully appreciated amount of your shares as a charitable contribution to the Milford Hospital Foundation.</p>
                            <h3>Matching Gifts</h3>
                            <p>Many companies will match their employees and retirees contributions (time and dollars) to Milford Hospital. Please contact your employer / former employer (usually Human Resources) to obtain the appropriate paperwork to process a matching gift to Milford Hospital.</p>
                            <h3>Real Estate</h3>
                            <p>This is a wonderful way for a donor to make a significant contribution. A gift of real estate will enable you to have major capital gains and tax benefits while at the same time helping Milford Hospital. Property that has been held for a long time makes an excellent charitable gift and gives you many advantages.</p>

                            <p>Planned giving is among the most important way donors may help to ensure the vitality of Milford Hospital for future generations. A planned gift may include a bequest in one's will, a trust arrangement, life income gifts, or gifts of life insurance. Planned gifts may be restricted for special purposes such as capital expansion, building and equipment purchases and also may be negotiated to "endow" the operations of specific hospital departments.</p>
                            <h3>Wills and Bequests</h3>
                            <p>You may decide to leave some part or all of your estate to the Milford Hospital Foundation. Bequests are an excellent option for those who want to pledge their support for Milford Hospital today, but cannot part with substantial assets during their lifetime.</p>
                            <h3>Life Income Gifts</h3>
                            <p>The Foundation encourages you to speak with your financial advisor about incomeproducing gifts such as Deferred Gift Annuities, Charitable Remainder Trusts, Charitable Remainder.</p>
                            <h3>Annuities and Retained Life Estates</h3>
                            <p>You may name Milford Hospital as a partial or sole beneficiary, of your life insurance policy. This is an ideal way to re-assign a policy that is no longer needed by you or your spouse, or that names beneficiaries that no longer require the future income.</p>
                            <p>If you would like more information on how you can help Milford Hospital in the future or in including Milford Hospital with this type of legacy gift, please contact the Milford Hospital Foundation at 203.647.7011. We would be happy to meet with you in person to discuss your personal areas of interest.</p>
